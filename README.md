# Monty Hall Problem

When you pick a door initially, you have a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance of
getting the prize. Switching involves picking BOTH of the other
doors. Because Monty opens one of the other doors first, you don’t
think that’s the case, but it is.

Run through the entire scenario, but instead of Monty opening a door
and then asking if you want to
switch, imagine Monty said, “Do you want to stick with your original
door, or do you want the other two?” Because that’s what’s happening.
Whether *he* opens the door with the goat behind it or *you* open
it, does not matter. 

If you don’t switch you will ALWAYS have a
$\frac{1}{3}$ chance. So 1 out of 3 times you’ll have picked the
right door. But if you *do* switch, you get the goat door plus the
other door, instead of only the original door. So 2 out of 3 times
switching is the right call. 

What makes it difficult is that people
can’t frame it that way. Instead they consider the door that Monty
opens as irrelavent, thinking that since it was already opened,
there are only two doors in the equation. 

It helps if you reframe the question with 100 doors.

You pick one. What are the odds of
getting the prize? $\frac{1}{100}$ Now Monty opens **98** doors and
shows you there is nothing behind them. Should you switch to the
remaining door? You bet! Because there is a $\frac{99}{100}$ chance
that the prize is there. Doesn’t matter whether you open the 99
doors yourself, or Monty opens 98 and you open the final door, if
you don’t switch you’re stuck with a $\frac{1}{100}$ chance of
getting the prize. 

So in the original problem, switching will net
you the prize 2 out of 3 times, and in the above reframing, switching
will net you the prize 99 out of 100 times.
